# fietspuzzeltocht

This is a website for a cycling puzzleroute!

Most of you probably won't use this, but this is for the area Woerden.

This project is a personal thing and for a group of people specifically to be done.

It relies on the geolocator. Clone the code to see how it works!

## Run the project

In order to run the project, you need a couple of things.

1. You need something like xampp in order to have apache2 and mysql. If you want to install those seperately on your own, make sure PHP support is enabled.
2. You need to setup the server for HTTPS. HTTP won't work because of security reasons of the geolocator.
3. Last of all you need to run the import.sql in order to create accounts and to go to all the checkpoints. It doesn't increment with the session variable.

Good luck, and have fun!
